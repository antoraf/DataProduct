## Understanding Gas Mileage vs hp/gear

Using the `mtcars` dataset, I 'm looking at the relationship of hp/gear and cylinders factors to gas mileage (`mpg`).

I plot hp/gear (`hp/gear`) vs. mileage (`mpg`) along the x/y axes, while the number of cylinders (`cyl`) as colors and the amount of horsepower (`hp`) as the size of an individual point in the plot.

## Conclusion
Mileage is related to # of cylinder and hp/gear seems also having strong correlation with mileage.
 
## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~hp/gear, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp/gear,
        text = ~paste("Hp: ", hp/gear, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data: mileage vs hp/gear")
```

## graph 2
```{r plot2, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~gear/hp, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(gear), size = ~gear/hp,
        text = ~paste("Hp: ", gear/hp, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data: mileage vs gear/hp")
```
